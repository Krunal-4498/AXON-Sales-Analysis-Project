# Axon Retail Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to address the sales data management and analysis issues faced by Axon, a retailer specializing in classic cars. Currently, the company lacks a centralized system to manage and analyze sales data, resulting in challenges for the sales team in making informed decisions and hindering management's ability to access accurate and up-to-date sales reports.

To overcome these challenges, the company has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) tool. After evaluating various options, Microsoft PowerBI and SQL have been shortlisted as potential BI tools for this project.

)
select Lead_time_Days, count(*) as Orders_count
from orders_lead_time
group by Lead_time_Days;
```

```sql 
select sum(quantityOrdered * priceEach)
from orderdetails od
join orders o on od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
where o.status = 'Shipped'
and date_format(o.orderDate, '%Y') = (
    select date_format(max(orderDate), '%Y')
    from orders
    where status = 'Shipped'
);
```

3. Revenue Month-to-Date (MTD)
```sql
select sum(quantityOrdered * priceEach)
from orderdetails od
join orders o on od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
where o.status = 'Shipped'
and date_format(o.orderDate, '%Y-%m') = (
    select date_format(max(orderDate), '%Y-%m')
    from orders
