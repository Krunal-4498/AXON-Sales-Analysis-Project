# Axon Retail Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to address the sales data management and analysis issues faced by Axon, a retailer specializing in classic cars. Currently, the company lacks a centralized system to manage and analyze sales data, resulting in challenges for the sales team in making informed decisions and hindering management's ability to access accurate and up-to-date sales reports.

To overcome these challenges, the company has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) tool. After evaluating various options, Microsoft PowerBI and SQL have been shortlisted as potential BI tools for this project.
